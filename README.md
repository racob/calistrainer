<h3 align="center">Calistrainer</h3>

  <p align="center">
    An iOS app that helps beginners practice simple calisthenic exercises such as squats and push-ups based on pose estimation. The app provides accurate exercise posture and tempo feedback using audio and visual cues. The app is 100% written with Swift and native library like Vision, utilizing SwiftUI as its main UI framework.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Calisthenics has been proven to be one of the most prevalent types of physical
exercise that has been engaged throughout centuries. Its popularity may be supported
by the fact that the exercise only requires body weight to practice without the need of
additional equipment nor specific environment.

Today, beginners still have problems in practicing basic calisthenics exercises
like squats and push-ups. The problems include difficulty in maintaining exercise
tempo and difficulty in practicing the correct form and posture. Both problems are
crucial factors that hugely affect the effectiveness of calisthenics exercise.

This study approaches the problem by utilizing computer vision a mobile
smartphone front facing camera, which is an instrument that is fairly accessible to most
modern society. An iOS application named Calistrainer is developed as a solution for
beginners by providing real-time feedback on their form and posture as well as aiding
exercise tempo maintenance. The study limits the calisthenics scope to squats and
push-ups as the exercises that is available to practice on the application.

The application was evaluated by 10 respondents through usability testing and
system usability scale (SUS) methods. 100% of the participants were able to complete
given tasks using the app and 60% of them gave SUS score above 80.3, which
indicates that the application is adequately intuitive and effective in approaching the
problems experienced by beginners in practicing basic calisthenics exercises.
